## Aggregated & Project Wise Results of Running U2W on 49 Subjects
The results of the tool on 49 subject projects can be found in the Reports.xlsx in the root directory. The report sheet contains consolidated results and each repo has its separate sheet for in-depth analysis.

## Project Wise Original And Refactored Test Files  
Original smelly test files and their automated refactored versions through our tool can be found in the folder in root directory called OriginalAndRefactoredTestFiles. 
For all our subject projects we have kept the same directory structure as the original projects. The refactored test files are in the same directory as the original test files, with the same file names but with a suffix of _Purified for assertion cluster based separated tests and _Parameterized for merged parameterized unit tests.
